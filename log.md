# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Completed the bootstrap front end library

**Thoughts** It wasn't too difficult as I've had html and css already in school but the next challenges might take some time

1. [Bootstrap Front-end Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/bootstrap/)

### Day 2: Nov 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on freecodecamp.org Might be able to do an actual project in a couple days there so thats cool. I might be able to find a project I could work on now in c++ Im not sure whats on freecodecamp at the moment I'll have to check tomorrow. The front end libraries are more for web site development and while thats interesting its not exactly what im looking to get into.

### Day 4: Dec 2, tuesday

**Today's Progress**: learned more react on freecodecamp was a bit harder got stuck a couple times but I figured it out with the built in help.
I had to look at the solution of one thing but I made sure I understood why it was like that after.

### Day 5: Dec 3, wednesday

**Todays Progress**: more react on freecodecamp couldn't do as much as I had been was a long day.

### Day 6:Dec 5, Friday

**Todays Progress**:I did some projects for school today in c++ took about 4 hours for the two projects I have to learn how to upload the code I could put it in here I guess not sure the proper way to do that so thats what I'll do for now.
