# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)


### Day 1: Nov 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Completed the bootstrap front end library

**Thoughts** It wasn't too difficult as I've had html and css already in school but the next challenges might take some time

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Bootstrap Front-end Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/bootstrap/)

### Day 2: Nov 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on freecodecamp.org Might be able to do an actual project in a couple days there so thats cool. I might be able to find a project I could work on now in c++ Im not sure whats on freecodecamp at the moment I'll have to check tomorrow. The front end libraries are more for web site development and while thats interesting its not exactly what im looking to get into.
